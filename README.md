# BlackJack-Game
Do you like Black Jack? Try the one I have created with Python. 
This is a classic Black Jack, in particular those are the rules:
1- to win you need a 21.
2- the dealer must ask a card if its sum is lower than the the player's one.
3- if you have a 1 you can give it a value of either 1 or 11, REMEMBER: YOU CANNOT CHANGE IT LATER.
4- if you stop before 21 and the dealer's sum is more than 21, you win. 
5- once you start playing, if you type 'no' the dealer starts playing automatically.
